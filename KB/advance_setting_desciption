###Advanced Setting: Moving Wumpus Module:
In this advanced setting, the Wumpus is no longer stationary. Instead, each Wumpus will move once after every
5 actions performed by the agent.
Movement Rules:
• After the agent has performed 5 actions (of any type: move, turn, grab, shoot, climb), each Wumpus will:
– Move to one of its valid adjacent cells (North, South, East, or West), chosen uniformly at random.
– The Wumpus movement is not observable to the agent, only inferred from percept changes.
– If the intended move would hit a wall, overlap with another Wumpus, or enter a pit, it stays in place.
Collision Rule:
• If a Wumpus moves into the agent’s current cell during its movement phase, the agent is immediately
killed (eaten by the Wumpus).
Purpose: Because the Wumpus can move, the environment becomes dynamic. The agent’s previous knowledge
about Wumpus locations can become outdated after each movement phase. Therefore, the agent must:
• Continuously update its internal map based on new percepts.
• Act cautiously, as Wumpus positions change over time.
Requirements:
• Modify your environment simulator to:
– Count the agent’s total actions and trigger Wumpus movement after every 5 actions.
– Implement Wumpus movement according to the rules above.
– Detect and handle agent-Wumpus collision (agent death).
• Update your inference engine to: Maintain agent knowledge consistency with percept updates after each
Wumpus movement phase.
This module challenges the agent to plan risk-aware decisions in a dynamic and partially observable environment.
